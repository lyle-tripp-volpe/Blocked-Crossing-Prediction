# And from there the "Actions" button at upper right gives an API option among others. The resulting pop-up box gives
# some info including a link to API documentation and a toggle to select SODA2 or SODA3. The API documentation is at this link:
# https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.transportation.gov/m2f8-22s6
# The below starter snippet code uses the SODA2 endpoint, but we can assess whether it might make more sense to use the SODA3 one instead, which would involve
# everyone applying for an app token and putting it in the .env file at repo root.
